The cha-folio theme is a [Fumadocs](https://fumadocs.dev/) theme for portfolio websites, tailored for academics and professionals to showcase their publications, projects, and more, but just as solid for anyone craving a clean, modern personal website or blog.

## Why cha-folio?

## Some Background

The cha-folio theme borrows the sleek aesthetic of [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio), which is a clean and elegant Jekyll theme packed with features that make portfolios look ðŸ”¥. However, even the tiniest text change in al-folio triggers a full-site rebuild, which can mean slow feedback loops, intense resource usage, and plenty of frustration when all you want is to hit Ctrl+S (or Cmd+S) and keep writing. This becomes more problematic as you add more content to your website, and cannot be helped due to its nature of being Jekyll-powered.

The cha-folio theme attempts to leverage the power of modern web development tools to provide a more efficient and enjoyable development and writing experience, while retaining the clean, minimal design of al-folio and most of its nice features. For instance, the hot reloading feature of Next.js allows you to see your changes immediately as you write, [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) makes it easy to customize your content, etc. And there are people <span className="text-fd-muted-foreground text-sm">(like me)</span> who are simply more familiar with the React and JS/TS ecosystem than Jekyll, so cha-folio can be a more comfortable choice for them.
