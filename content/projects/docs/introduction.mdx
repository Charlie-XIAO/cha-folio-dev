The cha-folio theme is a [Fumadocs](https://fumadocs.dev/) theme for portfolio websites, tailored for academics and professionals to showcase their publications, projects, and more, but just as solid for anyone craving a clean, modern personal website or blog.

## Motivation

The cha-folio theme borrows the sleek aesthetic of [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio), which is a clean and elegant Jekyll theme packed with features that make portfolios look ðŸ”¥. However, even the tiniest text change in al-folio triggers a full-site rebuild, which can mean slow feedback loops, intense resource usage, and plenty of frustration when all you want is to hit Ctrl+S (or Cmd+S) and keep writing. This becomes more problematic as you add more content to your website, and cannot be helped due to its nature of being Jekyll-powered.

The cha-folio theme is built on top of [Fumadocs](https://fumadocs.dev/) and thus [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), which means it is designed for a modern web development experience. It supports **hot reloading** out of the box, so you can see your changes immediately without waiting for a full rebuild by spinning up the Next.js development server. While retaining the clean, minimal design of al-folio and most of its nice features, cha-folio can provide a much faster and more flexible workflow.

Please do not worry if you are not a web developer. The cha-folio theme is designed to be content-centric and easy to use. Unless you want to extensively customize the theme,
